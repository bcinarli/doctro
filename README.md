# Doctro
Doctro is a clean and simple documentation template. You can freely use it for project. Just download or clone the project and replace its content with your own documentation.

## How to Use?
In template, Doctro has its own `doctro-` prefixed classes. For coding samples, wrap your codes with first `pre` and then `code` tags with the desired language highlight class.

The rest of is your content :)

## Supporting Languages
[prismjs](http://prismjs.com/) code highlight library is bundled with the  Doctro. By default, the supported languages and syntaxes are, Markup, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, Git, Java, Markdown, PHP, SQL and JSX. But anytime you can extend the code support from <strong>prismjs</strong>'s own download builder or replacing it with your preferred highlight library
