                <h1>Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell</h1>
                <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. He is here.</p>
                <h2>The Phantom Menace</h2>
                <p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Ye-ha!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
                    <li>I call it luck.</li>

                    <li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Attack of the Clones</h3>
                <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
                <h4>Revenge of the Sith</h4>
                <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>

                    <li>Don't underestimate the Force.</li>
                    <li>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</li>
                    <li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>
                    <li>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Revenge of the Sith</h5>
                <p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip;</p>
